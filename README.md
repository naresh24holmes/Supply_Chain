weight of the product(noodles) is the target variable.

Data pre-processing has been performed to take of missing values and Outlier treatment is done in feature engineering phase.

Exploratory data analysis has been performed to establish the relationships between independent and target variable and all insights have been verified by performing hypothesis testing with each independent against the target variable.
